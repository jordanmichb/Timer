# Timer

The timer app runs a full session, followed by a break period, followed by a session, and so on until the timer is reset.
When a session or break reaches 00:00, a timer goes off.
The timer can be paused or reset to the current "session" and "break" values.
Session length and break length cannot be modified until the timer is reset.
